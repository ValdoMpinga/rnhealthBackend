The RnHealth project features an advanced application built using Django for the backend and React for the frontend.

## Key Features:

- **6-Hour Indoor Radon Level Forecasts:** Utilizing state-of-the-art LSTM and Bi-LSTM algorithms, the application provides accurate forecasts for indoor radon levels over a 6-hour period.
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE) Calculation:** The application computes the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for the generated forecasts, ensuring accuracy assessment and aiding in performance evaluation.
